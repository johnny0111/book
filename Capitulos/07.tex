}

There are many myths and misconceptions about drinking water, and it's important to separate fact from fiction to make sure you're drinking water like a pro. Here are some common myths and the truth behind them:
Myth: You need to drink 8 glasses of water a day.
Truth: There's no one-size-fits-all answer to how much water you should drink. The amount of water you need depends on factors like your age, weight, activity level, and climate. However, a good rule of thumb is to drink enough water so that you're not thirsty and your urine is a light yellow color.\newline \newline
Myth: You should only drink water when you're thirsty. \\
Truth: While thirst is a good indicator of when you need to drink water, it's important to drink water regularly throughout the day. Waiting until you're thirsty can mean that you're already dehydrated.\\
Myth: Drinking water during meals dilutes your stomach acid and makes it harder to digest food.\\
Truth: Drinking water during meals can actually help with digestion by helping to break down food and prevent constipation. However, it's best to avoid drinking large amounts of water during meals as it can make you feel bloated.\\
Myth: You can't drink too much water.\\
Truth: While it's important to stay hydrated, drinking too much water can actually be dangerous. This is because it can dilute the salt in your body and cause a condition called hyponatremia. It's important to drink enough water to stay hydrated, but not so much that you're overhydrated.\\
Myth: You should always drink water at room temperature.\\
Truth: While room temperature water is a good option, drinking cold water can actually be more refreshing, especially on a hot day or after exercising. However, it's important to not drink ice-cold water too quickly as it can cause brain freeze.\\
Myth: Drinking water can cure a hangover.\\
Truth: While drinking water can help alleviate some symptoms of a hangover like headache and dry mouth, it won't cure a hangover. The only real cure for a hangover is time and rest.\\
Myth: Drinking water with lemon can help you lose weight.
